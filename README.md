My personal custom vscode themes.

Currently contains the following custom themes: Hedgehog, Monokai Dimmed New (an alternative version of the theme Monokai Dimmed by Microsoft).

To download a local version of this theme vscode extension you need to follow these steps:

1. Install vsce using `npm install -g vsce`.

2. In a terminal, go to this project directory and package the extension with `vsce package`. Enter `y` to bypass missing file errors. This should create a `custom-vscode-themes-1.0.0.vsix` in the project directory.

3. You can now use `code --install-extension custom-vscode-themes-1.0.0.vsix` to add this extension to your local vscode.

4. You can now set themes from this extension.

**Enjoy!**
